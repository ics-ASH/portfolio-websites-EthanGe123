  <h1>Computer hardware comprises physical components like the CPU, memory, and storage devices, essential for processing and storing data. The motherboard acts as the main circuit board connecting various components. Input devices, such as keyboards and mice, enable user interaction, while output devices, like monitors and printers, display processed information. Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) handle graphical tasks, and networking components allow connection to networks. Cooling systems prevent overheating, and understanding hardware components is crucial for building and maintaining computer systems.</h1>
