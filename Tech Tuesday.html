   <h1>AI stands for artificial intelligence. It’s a technology that makes computers and machines possible to enhance the precision, effort and quickness of humans. AI is able to perform tasks more efficiently than humans, like digital assistants, GPS guidance systems, vehicle navigation, generative AI tools and more. Present day, AI is revolutionizing, and is quickly becoming more and more accessible. Applications for AI are developing every day, so it’s important to know the types of AI.</h1>
   <h1>The main types of AI are weak AI and strong AI. Weak AI is known as narrow AI or artificial narrow intelligence (ANI), they are focused to do certain tasks. Weak AI is usually what drives most AI of today.</h1>
   <h1>Strong AI is characterized by artificial general intelligence (AGI) and artificial super intelligence (ASI). AGI or general AI is one of many forms of AI that has an intelligence equivalent to humans, meaning it’s self aware, has the ability to solve problems, learn and more. ASI is also known as superintelligence is AI that includes intelligence beyond the ability of a human's brain.</h1>

  <h1>Week #4 - Blockchains</h1>
  <h1>Article:</h1>
  <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/what-is-blockchain/">visit This website!</a>
  <h1>Blockchains are ledgers online that make the process of transactions, contracts and more in a business network. Although any normal database is able to store this kind of information, blockchain should be in its own category because it’s quite unique. In preference to being handled in one place by an administrator, the identical copies of the database blockchains are maintained on many computers spread out across a network. The individual computers are called nodes.</h1> 
  <h1>So, how do they work? Well, the name “Blockchain” came from the way it stores its transaction data. The digital ledger is usually expressed as a “chain” that is made up of individual “blocks” of data. When new data is added to the network, another “block” is made and attached to the chain. This includes all nodes to update their blockchain to be identical. The way the blocks are made is essential to why blockchain is highly secure. A lot of the nodes need to be verified in order to see how legit the information is before a new block can be added to the ledger. In cryptocurrency, they could check that new transactions in a block were not counterfeit or coins that haven’t been spent more than once. Transactions are often secured using cryptography: the nodes need to solve difficult mathematical equations to process transactions.</h1>
  <h1>Blockchains can be used on banks and voting systems. Firstly, blockchain for banks can be used to process transactions in fiat currency, like dollars and euros. Blockchain has faster processing times and a more clear system. Secondly, blockchain for voting can be used to prevent vote fraud. Blockchain voting will allow people to submit ballots that cannot be tampered with and eliminate the need for people to manually collect and verify paper ballots.</h1>
  <h1>Blockchains have lots of advantages and disadvantages, about advantages. It has higher transaction accuracy, for example if one node has an error in its database, other nodes will see its difference and catch the error. About disadvantages, its energy costs are very high because all its nodes working to transact require more electricity than a single database or spreadsheet. Not only does this make blockchain transactions more expensive, but it also places a huge carbon burden on the environment.</h1>
  <h1>Lastly, Blockchain is an online ledger that enables transactions, contracts, and other processes to take place within a business network. It organizes and summarizes information through "chains" of individual "chunks" of data. And the usefulness of blockchain is very large and widespread, it can be used in banking and voting systems. Blockchain has many advantages and disadvantages, such as having higher transaction accuracy and very high energy costs.</h1>

  <h1>Week #5 - Robotics</h1>
  <h1>Article:</h1>
  <a href="https://www.hotelmanagement-network.com/interviews/how-robots-are-easing-hospitalitys-staff-shortage/?cf-view">visit This website!</a>
  <h1>Using tech in busy establishments like the hospital has plenty of benefits for the staff. Lately, many hospitals and caregiving places have been facing many staff shortages. As robotics and tech continue to improve, companies have been finding ways to alleviate the shortages and replacing them with robots. During the Covid-19 pandemic in Europe, many countries experienced staffing gaps. To this day, it still remains a problem across Europe.</h1>
  <h1>Now, using robotics could plug hospitality’s talent gap, and there are two specific benefits of introducing robots in the hospitality industry-robots can improve employee satisfaction and employee availability. Since both of these are boring, constantly repetitive and unpleasant tasks, the introduction of robots can effectively improve the situation. As robots replace painful tasks, it may reduce the rate of sickness, and increase better working conditions.</h1>
  <h1>According to Mahmoud, “You better handle the labour shortage and you create a kind of virtuous cycle. You give staff a tool that is going to help them to do their job better and focus on where they prefer to focus, especially in hospitality. It’s about taking care of other people.” Mahmoud discusses the many positives about having robots in the workplace. He also suggests that it can also assist in antisocial shifts, like having robots to serve breakfast service.</h1>
  <h1>The responses towards robotic technologies are usually positive. Mahmoud said, “Customer responses are most of the time very positive because we are a European company and we are building European solutions for European needs.” They want to maintain the human connection and their companies are Introducing robots as a way to help their employees rather than replace them, however, there are some people who are currently refusing to introduce robots, they are afraid that they are going to be replaced by robots and that their company is going to sack them. However, at the moment, human resources are a necessity in every industry and industries need them to perform the highest value-added tasks.</h1>
  <h1>Lastly, robots can also expand in other caregiving facilities, like restaurants, retail, elderly care homes, hotels, and more. For example, robots can help take the pressure off hotel staff, and can also be used for food delivery, medicine delivery (depending on the country/region) and waste disposal. Of course, robots can also be used in retail, where they can lift heavy objects, streamline processes and enhance marketing. Overall, as Mouhmad said, “It’s all about bringing  the product off of the shelf and giving it more visibility.”</h1>

  <h1>The Internet of things has been improving dramatically and it can positively transform the way people live and work. In the healthcare industry, it's evident that healthcare workers have been primarily using pen and paper to collect data from patients for decades. Now, healthcare technology is upgrading faster than ever before.</h1>
  <h1>Physicians have been adopting digital tools to keep up and have adapted to the demands of the workplace. These demands are being driven by evolving business models such as value-based reimbursement and virtual care, and by technologies such as electronic health records (EHRs) and precision medicine. Individuals believe that the greatest technological leap forward was the evolution of EHRs. Hospitals have many systems that use different systems that focus on other functions, but EHRs put all of the above into one system. EHR software developers have control to unlock patient information locked in their technology systems. This causes companies to face criticism due to making the access to patient data difficult to access. 80% of clinicians agreed that their current EHR system supports better patient outcomes, according to Hewlett Packard Enterprise's May 2021 survey.</h1>
  <h1>The Internet can help patients ask for medical advice online and continuously track an individual's health status and medication needs through technology. For example, "RPM," which can be effective in improving outcomes and reducing costs, utilizes this technology to provide healthcare providers with a continuous stream of real-time health data, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and blood glucose monitoring. And the future of this technology is very promising, with 70.6 million RPM users expected in the U.S. by 2025.</h1>
  <h1>As a result, the Internet is revolutionizing the healthcare industry. In current hospitals, ultrasound, thermometers, blood glucose monitors, electrocardiograms, and other equipment all require the Internet so that patients can be quickly informed of their health status, and smart beds are also widely used in hospitals, which sense the position of the patient's body and automatically adjusts to the correct angle and pressure according to the position in order to provide the right amount of support without the need for manual adjustment by healthcare professionals. And in the event of an accident, this technology allows doctors to be aware of any potentially dangerous patient behavior and make timely adjustments.</h1>
  <h1>Overall, a lot of companies are looking for profit for creating and developing products for specific medical applications, increasing collaborative research and development and acquiring new startups.  Microsoft has made Microsoft Azure cloud platform to facilitate cloud-based  delivery for lots of healthcare services. Other companies are looking to make similar platforms, like Proteus, Neurotech, Helix, Genoox and more.</h1>
