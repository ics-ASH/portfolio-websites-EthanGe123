He averaged about 24.5 points per game for his career, hitting over 3,000 three-pointers at a rate of about 43%. He is the best three-point shooter in NBA history, but he was not only a great scorer, he was also a great organizer. He averaged about 6.5 assists per game in his career. He was also a strong rebounder and defender, averaging about 4.5 rebounds and about 1.7 steals per game. Curry is a four-time NBA champion, two-time regular season MVP, and a multiple-time All-Star and All-NBA Team selection. His leadership and influence have made him the centerpiece of the Golden State Warriors and have profoundly changed the way the NBA plays, ushering in a new era where the three-point shot has become an integral part of the game. Curry's career was not only statistically mind-blowing, but also had a profound impact on basketball.</h1>
